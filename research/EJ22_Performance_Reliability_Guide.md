## 🎯 Executive Summary

The EJ22 is a **reliable platform when properly maintained**, but requires more attention than typical Japanese economy engines. Japanese tuning culture emphasizes preventive maintenance as the foundation for performance modifications. The EJ22 responds well to bolt-on modifications, with realistic expectations:

- **Stage 1 (bolt-ons):** +15-20 HP (naturally aspirated)
- **Stage 2 (cam + tuning):** +25-35 HP  
- **Stage 3 (forced induction):** +80-150 HP (major investment)

**Key Philosophy (from Japanese sources):** メンテナンスすれば15万キロ20万キロは走ることは可能 ("With proper maintenance, 150-200k km is achievable")

## 🔧 Stage 1: Budget-Friendly Daily Driver Mods ($500-1500)

### Proven Bolt-On Gains

**1. Intake & Exhaust Flow ($300-800)**
- **Headers:** Unequal length 4-2-1 stainless steel headers (~$200-400)
  - Real-world: Australian owner reported noticeable improvement
  - Japanese shops (TOMEI, HKS) recommend equal-length for turbo builds, unequal for NA torque
- **Cold Air Intake:** Pod filter + adapter (~$50-150)
  - Ford Explorer V6 example: +19 HP from pod filter alone
  - EJ22 realistic: +5-10 HP
- **Cat-Back Exhaust:** Free-flowing muffler (~$150-300)
  - Avoid too large diameter (reduces low-end torque)
  - 2.25" - 2.5" optimal for NA EJ22

**Expected Gains:** +10-15 HP, improved throttle response, better sound

**2. ECU Tuning/Piggyback ($300-500)**
- Aftermarket ECU if factory is locked
- **Realistic NA gains:** ~15% power increase with supporting mods
- **Critical:** Must include knock protection
- Japanese tuners emphasize proper setup over peak numbers

**Total Stage 1 Investment:** ~$600-1300  
**Total Gains:** +15-20 HP, improved drivability

---

## 🔨 Stage 2: Enthusiast Modifications ($1500-3500)

**1. Camshafts ($400-800 + $300-600 install)**
- **Fast road cams:** Best for street driving
  - Increase mid-high RPM power
  - Minor low-end torque loss acceptable for spirited driving
- **Avoid competition cams for daily use:**
  - Lumpy idle
  - Poor low-end response
  - Japanese mechanics warn: "traffic driving will be miserable"

**2. Port & Polish Head ($800-1500)**
- Remove flow restrictions
- Smooth turbulence
- Best when combined with larger valves

**3. High-Flow Fuel System ($400-800)**
- Upgraded injectors
- Performance fuel pump
- Required for Stage 2+ power levels

**Expected Gains:** +25-35 HP over stock  
**Total Stage 2 Investment:** ~$2700-3900

---

## 🚀 Stage 3: Serious Performance ($5000-10000+)

**Forced Induction (Turbo/Supercharger)**
- Most cost-effective power per dollar at high HP levels
- NA-to-turbo conversion requires:
  - Forged internals (pistons, rods)
  - Upgraded head gasket (RCM 0.78mm performance gasket)
  - Standalone ECU
  - Intercooler, piping, BOV
  - Fuel system overhaul
  - Oil system upgrades

**Japanese Tuner Kits:**
- **TOMEI ARMS T390M/T440M Single Scroll Turbo Kit** (high-end, proven)
- **HKS GT Series** (widely supported)

**Expected Gains:** +80-150 HP (conservative tuning for reliability)

## 🛡️ Critical Maintenance Items

### Universal EJ Engine Issues (from ZEROMAX Japan)

**1. Head Gasket Oil Leaks**
- **Japanese wisdom:** "EJエンジンで漏れない車は無い" ("No EJ engine doesn't leak")
- **Not a catastrophic failure,** but requires attention
- **RCM High Performance Head Gasket:** 0.78mm thickness, improved sealing
- Combine with timing belt service (~10万円 / $700-900 USD)

**2. Power Steering Pump Failure**
- **Certainty:** "確実にいつか壊れます" ("It WILL fail eventually")
- Budget $300-600 for replacement
- More common in GC/GD chassis but affects all

**3. Timing Belt Replacement (Critical @ 100k km / 60k mi)**
- **10万キロに行く前にベルトの交換が必要** ("Replace before 100k km")
- EJ engines are interference engines (catastrophic failure if belt breaks)
- Cost: ~$800-1200 USD
- Combine with water pump, idlers, tensioners

**4. TGV Valve & Secondary Air Combi Valve (GR/GV/VAB models)**
- **Time bomb:** Fails at 7-10万キロ (70-100k km)
- Requires intake manifold removal
- High labor cost
- **Preventive replacement recommended at 60k km**

**5. Hub Bearing Play (GC/GD especially)**
- Rust/corrosion exacerbates issue
- Front strut design = expensive labor
- Check during brake service

## 💡 Japanese Tuning Philosophy

**From ZEROMAX (Subaru specialist shop):**

> "スバル車はプロボックスやヴィッツのように  
> ノーメンテで乗り続けられる車ではない"
> 
> "Subaru vehicles are not cars you can drive with zero maintenance like a ProBox or Vitz [Toyota econoboxes]"

**Cultural Context:**
- Japanese owners expect 6-month inspection intervals
- Preventive maintenance culture vs. run-to-failure
- Specialized knowledge required (many general shops refuse EJ work due to complexity)

**Key Insight:**
- EJ engines aren't fragile, they're **high-maintenance**
- Regular attention = 150-200k km lifespan
- Deferred maintenance = expensive compounding failures

## 🔬 Cost-Effective Path for dlorp's '97 Impreza

### Phase 1: Preventive Maintenance Foundation ($800-1200)
1. **Timing belt service** (if not recently done)
   - Belt, water pump, idlers, tensioners
   - Inspect for head gasket seepage
2. **Fluid refresh**
   - High-quality oil (5W-30 synthetic)
   - Coolant flush
   - Transmission fluid (if applicable)
3. **Baseline diagnostics**
   - OBD2 scanner (Evoscan setup from previous research)
   - Establish performance baseline

### Phase 2: Bolt-On Performance ($600-1000)
1. **Headers** ($200-400)
2. **Pod filter** ($50-100)
3. **Free-flow muffler** ($150-300)
4. **ECU tune** (if piggyback available, $300-500)

**Expected Result:** +15-20 HP, better throttle response, improved sound

### Phase 3: Optional Enhancements (as budget allows)
1. **Fast road cam** ($700-1400 installed) — biggest mechanical gain
2. **Port & polish** ($800-1500) — if head work needed anyway
3. **Fuel system** ($400-800) — if pursuing forced induction later
